A00001 - Solving XOR via simple neural network

XOR (Exclusive OR) outputs 1 if inputs are different, 0 if the same.

Truth table:
```
(0, 0) → 0
(0, 1) → 1
(1, 0) → 1
(1, 1) → 0
```

XOR is not linearly separable that means you can't just rotate a line to get it act as a xor function

A neural network doing backpropogation with a hidden layer can solve this since it allows for non-linearty via use of activation functions
